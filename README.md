# Phase-1-Project

Our website uses a makeupAPI to filter through all the makeup products. This website has a search lookup feature that the user can search by product type or brand. This is the first event listener of the website. The second feature that this website has to offer is the manual or browsing feature. By clicking (second event listener) the "Product List" button to the left of the search bar, the user can filter through by first  choosing the product they are looking for. Then by scrolling down they can click on the brand they are interested in and it will display all of the product from that brand. Our third event listener was the mouseover event of the buttons and the image of the product that shows the price.
